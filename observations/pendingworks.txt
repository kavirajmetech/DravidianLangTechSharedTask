Data Exploration Techniques
Class Distribution Analysis:

Visualize the distribution of the different classes to understand how balanced the dataset is. This can be done using bar charts or pie charts.

Word Clouds:

Create word clouds for each class to identify the most common words and phrases. This helps in understanding the dominant themes within each class.

Frequency Distribution:

Analyze the frequency of words in the corpus. This can be done by plotting the most frequent words for each class.

Text Length Distribution:

Examine the distribution of text lengths across the dataset. This can help in understanding the typical length of tweets and setting appropriate padding or truncation lengths for model inputs.

N-gram Analysis:

Look at the frequency of bigrams and trigrams to uncover common word sequences. This can reveal interesting patterns that single-word analysis might miss.

Sentiment Analysis:

Perform sentiment analysis to determine the overall sentiment of the tweets. This can provide insights into the emotional tone of the data.

Word Embeddings Visualization:

Use techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or t-SNE to visualize word embeddings in 2D or 3D space. This helps in understanding the relationships between different words or phrases.

Correlation Matrix:

Create a correlation matrix to explore the relationships between different features or classes. This can be useful for identifying patterns or dependencies.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Reports:

Generate comprehensive EDA reports using libraries like pandas-profiling or Sweetviz. These tools automatically provide a detailed overview of the dataset, including distributions, correlations, and missing values.

Keyword Extraction:

Extract and analyze key phrases or topics within the tweets. This can help in understanding the main themes and subjects discussed in the data.

Comparing Embeddings with Pre-trained Models:

Generate Embeddings:

Use pre-trained models like BERT or IndicBERT to generate embeddings for your dataset.

Visualize Embeddings:

Use PCA or t-SNE to visualize the generated embeddings in a lower-dimensional space.

Compute Similarity:

Use cosine similarity or other distance metrics to compare your generated embeddings with those from pre-trained models.

Cluster Analysis:

Perform clustering (e.g., K-Means) on the embeddings to identify natural groupings within the data.

Analyze Differences:

Compare the clusters and similarities to understand how well your dataset aligns with the pre-trained embeddings.
